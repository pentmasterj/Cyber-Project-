# Project 1 

This project entailed a lengthy process of deploying, mangaging, and configuring the cloud platform in Microsoft Azure. The requirements of this assignment were to effectively create and sustain the student's own cloud environment. 

The Cloud is a virtualization of hardware and software to help companies save money and become more secure for their short, medium, and long-term plans. The Cloud platform the student's used to create this cloud environment was Microsoft Azure. Azure is a complete cloud setup environment that allows businesses and other customers create, maintain and deploy their own applications. In this case, that's exactly what the student's executed. 

As it pertains to the structure of the project, we were instructed to deploy a virtual machine, within it's own private network and resource group. In the middle of the project, we were to create a docker container to run with the virtual machine. Once the docker container was configured and deployed, the student could connect the virtual machines and container to the Kibana to further create the ELK Stack. 

The Elk stack is a log monitoring platform that allows administrators to monitor traffic for real-time analysis for mitigation and repudiation.
